# KYC BOT

## Introduction:

KYC Bot presents a modern solution to the age-old challenge faced by banks: streamlining the Know Your Customer (KYC) process. Developed with efficiency and compliance in mind, this tool leverages Azure services such as Azure Blob Storage and Azure Machine Learning to simplify and enhance the verification of customer identities, benefiting both banks and customers alike.

## How it Works:
Using KYC Bot is remarkably straightforward. Initially, the bot retrieves essential details such as names and addresses from Aadhar cards, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Leveraging Azure Blob Storage, this data is securely stored and managed, adhering to the highest standards of data privacy and security.

Next, users are prompted to display their Aadhar card to a webcam, where the bot captures a photo with a single click. This image is then seamlessly processed and analyzed using Azure Machine Learning models, comparing it against the bank's existing records. Through advanced image recognition and verification algorithms, the system swiftly confirms the accuracy of the information provided, delivering a seamless experience for users while reducing manual effort for bank staff.

## What it Aims to Solve:
KYC Bot addresses the inefficiencies and challenges associated with traditional KYC processes. By automating the verification process and reducing manual data entry, it aims to save time and resources for both banks and customers. Leveraging Azure Machine Learning, KYC Bot enhances accuracy and reliability, helping mitigate errors and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

By utilizing Azure services, KYC Bot not only streamlines the KYC process but also provides a scalable and secure solution that can seamlessly integrate into Standard Chartered's workflow. With its focus on simplicity, efficiency, and compliance, KYC Bot aims to revolutionize the KYC process, making it simpler, faster, and more convenient for all parties involved.
